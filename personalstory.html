						<font size="4px"><p> I got my cat around the time i was about 10 years old. well she's originally my neighbors cat but i take care of her like she's my own. When she would come over to my house i would give her some of my other cats food and then she would just hang around and i would play with her. Whenever i come home from school she's always in our drive way just waiting like she knows what time i come home. Even now when i come home I see her there waiting by the door. I like to think of her as my own pet and i love taking care of her because it makes me feel like im doing something for her to make her life better. along the way i would take care of other pets ( mainly cats) that would come over to my house and i actually love taking care of them. That's why i thought it would be a great idea to do my website on why you should adopt and how adopting is great. With a little bit of information on each page, hopefully it will convince you to want to adopt a pet too.</p>
