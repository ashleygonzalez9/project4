		<p> I got my first dog, Fred; at the westside pavillion mall where they used to have a pet store. We thought he was really cute and we were really interested in looking for a dog and this one was a goldendoodle. The second dog, Rocky;  we got a year later we went on craigslist and saw golden retriever puppies for sale so we eventually got him at only five weeks old. To this day, my family has never regretted adopting these two dogs and my family has adopted dogs in the past.</p></div>

	<div class="box12"><p> While I was working with youth in low-income communities one of my students came in said she found a kitty but she couldn’t keep him and didn’t want him to go to the pound so she asked me if I wanted him and made me promise to take care of him and not let anything happen to him. At first i wasn’t sure if i was able to take care of a kitty because kitten has a lot of work however with the help with everyone in the family his house training became very easy we all welcomed him into our family we untethered him got his shots and a flea collar of course and ever since he’s been another member of our family, literally. We decided to name him Peanut Butter.  Soon after we got (peanut butter the cat) another student came to me, someone gave her a bunny but she couldn’t take care of him so she new I already taken in a kitten so she hoped I would also take a baby rabbit, I already had a kitten to take care of and a baby rabbit also seemed a lot of work and I didn;t know how my baby cat would react to another animal in the house so at first I declined and went home and gave it some thought. After a day or two, I decided to take him on also. And so I brought him home we named Bob. Peanut butter along with everyone in the family instantly loved bob. He was the cutest bunny not only did we have one baby kitten in the house, we had two baby animals to look after. It was hard work to look after both of them but they brought such joy to our home. peanut butter and Bob became the bestest friends they were inseparable. At first, they would eat together, play with each other bob would go on walks while peanut butter would stay indoors than when he would come back inside peanut butter was ready to play until one day bob became really sick and passed away.  When Bob passed away we had a mini funeral and buried him in our backyard. He gave life to our garden. 
Once he was gone peanut butter looked for him for days this was very sad but we had plenty of memorable memories. Peanut butter is still in our lives to this day, getting older but he’s such a good cat. We love him and wouldn’t give him up for anything in the world.</p></div>
