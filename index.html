	<font size="5px"><p> "I feel like cats and dogs are very important to us. Whenever you need them for anything, I guess they are just always there for you and always there to comfort you. That is why adopting them will benefit both your life and their life. Itâ€™s just like why not adopt them then watching them suffer because if they are not adopted then they will be sent to shelters in which they will be harmed." </p>

		<center><font size="4px"><p> Here are the surveys that i made from the data i collected about people that own a pet and people that don't own one. One the left is the survey about people that don't own a pet and if they would want to adopt one. Majority of the votes said that they would consider adopting a pet. 
	One the right is the image of the survey about pet owners and i asked them with having a pet already, would the want to adopt another one. Same as the other data, most people would want to adopt another one. So this goes to show that people like having pets around and they would prefer to have on in their life.</p>
